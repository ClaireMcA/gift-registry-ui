        <strong>FAQ</strong>
    </h1>
    <h3>
        <strong>What should I wear?</strong><br/>
        <em>We have labelled it as semi-formal, but we're not too fussy about what you wear. Keep in mind that it can get quite hot in the Canberra summer, but both the ceremony and reception will be held indoors. The main thing to keep in mind is we'll be dancing on a concrete floor, so it might be best to bring a pair of suitable shoes!</em>

    <br/>
    <h3>
        <strong>What if 'COVID' happens?</strong><br/>
        <em>If our plans need to change due to covid restrictions, we will contact everyone directly via SMS. We will also keep all the information on this site up-to-date with any changes we make - so check back here if you are unsure.</em>
        
    </h3>
    <br/>
    <h3>
        <strong>Will I have to leave the venue between the Ceremony and the Reception?</strong><br/>
        <em>Yes. Unfortunately, due to covid density requirements, we've decided to do the ceremony and reception at the same location. This means that there will be a set up/pack down period between the two components. We expect the ceremony to finish at ~2pm and doors will be open for the reception at 5pm.</em>
    </h3>
    <br/>
    <h3>
        <strong>Can I bring my kids to the Reception?</strong><br/>
        <em>While we do love your kids, we thought you might like to have a relaxing night off. So we hope you understand that only kids in our immediate families will be at the reception. If you do run into trouble finding a babysitter for the night, please let us know.</em>
    </h3>
    <br/>
    <h3>
        <strong>Can I bring my kids to the Ceremony?</strong><br/>
        <em>Absolutely! We would love to have your whole family there!</em>
        
    </h3>
    <br/>
    <h3>
        <strong>Where can I go between the Ceremony and the Reception?</strong><br/>
        <em>The Kingston Foreshore is a very short walk away and has lots of great cafes, bars, and restaurants. There are also some great walks around Lake Burley Griffin. We will provide a 'To-Do' pamphlet following the ceremony with a few more suggestions of where to go.</em>
    </h3>
    <br/>
    <h3>
        <strong>I'm coming from interstate, do you have any recommendation of where I should stay?</strong><br/>
        <em>There are a number of great hotels/AirBnB's in the Kingston area. If you need any suggestions feel free to contact us!</em>
    </h3>
    <br/>
    <h3>
        <strong>What if I feel sick on the day?</strong><br/>
        <em>Unforunately, due to current COVID restrictions, we need to ask you to stay home if you have any symptoms of COVID-19.</em>
