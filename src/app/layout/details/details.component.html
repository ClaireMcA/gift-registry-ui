        <strong class="text-primary-900" >FAQ</strong>
    </h1>
    <h3>
        <strong class="text-primary-900" >What should I wear?</strong><br/>
        <em>The wedding will be semi-formal. The ceremony will be indoors but the reception will be in a sheltered outdoor space.</em>
    </h3>
    <br/>
    <h3>
        <strong class="text-primary-900" >Can I bring the kids?</strong><br/>
        <em>We welcome your children to the ceremony and look forward to sharing our celebration with them! However, we have decided to keep the reception child-free except for those in our family. We hope you can understand this decision and enjoy a night off from the rascals! If you are having trouble finding a babysitter, please let us know.</em>

    <h3>
        <strong class="text-primary-900" >What can I do between the ceremony and reception?</strong><br/>
        <em>Yass has some nice spaces for you to explore. You can take a stroll down the main street and check out the little niche stores, meander along Yass River through Riverbank Park, grab a coffee at one of the many local cafes (Trader & Co is a favourite!) or head on over to The Clubhouse Hotel to grab a drink before the party begins.</em>

    <h3>
        <strong class="text-primary-900" >I am travelling from afar and will need accomodation. Any suggestions?</strong><br/>
        <em>There are a number of motels in Yass if you'd like accommodation close to the festivities. Alternatively, there are many accommodation options in Canberra. Belconnen or a northern suburb of Canberra will be an optimal location to get onto the Barton Highway to head out to Yass. Yass is about a 45 minute drive from Canberra, so if you are flying down and need help with transport, let us know!</em>
